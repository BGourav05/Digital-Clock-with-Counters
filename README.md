# Digital Clock with Counters (HH:MM:SS)

## Description
A digital clock implemented in Verilog using cascaded counters to display time in HH:MM:SS format. It uses a clock divider to generate a 1 Hz pulse, BCD counters for seconds, minutes, and hours, and multiplexed seven-segment displays for output.

## Concepts Covered
- Binary and BCD counters
- Clock division and frequency scaling
- Seven-segment display multiplexing
- Timing and synchronization in digital systems

## Extensions
- Add alarm or stopwatch features for advanced functionality.

## Tools
- Icarus Verilog / ModelSim (simulation)
- Vivado (FPGA implementation on Basys or Nexys board)
